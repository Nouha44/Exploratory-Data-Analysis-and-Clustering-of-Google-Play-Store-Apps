# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Clustering-of-Google-Play-Store-Apps
In our data analytics project, we aim to gain valuable insights into the performance and characteristics of Google Play Store apps. To achieve this, we follow a systematic approach. Firstly, we commence by cleaning and preprocessing the raw data obtained from the Google Play Store. This involves removing any duplicate entries, handling missing values, and standardizing the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Once the data is cleaned, we move on to the phase of principal components analysis (PCA). PCA allows us to identify and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming the original features into a set of orthogonal components called principal components. By extracting these components, we can effectively capture the underlying patterns and variability within the data, facilitating further analysis and interpretation.

After performing PCA, we proceed to the final stage of our project, which involves classification using the K-means algorithm. K-means is an unsupervised learning technique that partitions the data into clusters based on their similarity. By applying K-means to our preprocessed dataset, we aim to categorize Google Play Store apps into distinct groups based on their shared characteristics. This classification can provide valuable insights for app developers, marketers, and decision-makers, helping them understand user preferences, identify trends, and optimize their app development strategies.

In summary, our data analytics project on Google Play Store apps begins with data cleaning, followed by principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality, and concludes with classification using the K-means algorithm. This systematic approach enables us to uncover meaningful patterns and insights within the vast amount of data available, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and enhance their app development and marketing efforts.
